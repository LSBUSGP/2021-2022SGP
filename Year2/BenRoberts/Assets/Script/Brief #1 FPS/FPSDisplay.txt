FPS Counter

Open a Unity project
Install and import the FPS Package
Right-click the hierarchy and follow UI -> Text - TextMeshPro
Attach the ‘FPSDisplay’ script to the canvas
Drag in the TextMeshPro text into the ‘Fps text’ section of the script
Reposition the text where you would like the counter to appear
Turn off Vsync to prevent your monitor refresh rate from limiting your fps
Press play and your counter will now be counting the current fps
